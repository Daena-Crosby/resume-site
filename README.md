# 🌟 Daena Crosby – Portfolio Website  

Welcome to my portfolio! This site is more than just a collection of projects; it’s a reflection of my journey as a **Frontend Web Developer & UI/UX Designer**. I built it to showcase not only my technical skills but also my design philosophy: clean, responsive, and user‑focused experiences that feel both modern and personal.

## ✨ What Makes This Portfolio Stand Out  

- **Modern UI/UX** – A polished interface with smooth animations, thoughtful layouts, and a professional aesthetic.  
- **Dark Mode** – A toggleable light/dark theme that adapts to user preferences.  
- **Fully Responsive** – Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop so it looks great everywhere.  
- **Accessibility First** – WCAG 2.1 compliant with keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen reader support.  
- **Performance Optimized** – Fast load times with lazy loading, code splitting, and efficient asset handling.  
- **Interactive Contact Form** – Powered by Supabase with email fallback, ensuring recruiters and collaborators can always reach me.  
- **Project Showcase** – Real projects with live demos and GitHub links, highlighting both technical depth and design creativity.
